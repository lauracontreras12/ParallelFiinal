# Parallel Final Project
Final Project for Parallel Programming Course. 

# Project Goal:
The purpose of the project is to build a model that properly predicts whether a patient will be susceptible 
to a stroke. Because of how prevalent the disease is in the US, and globally, if a model can accurately
predict the diagnosis, then doctors will be able to intervene earlier than later. By comparing different
logistic regression models on their accuracy and F-1 score, an accurate model is selected.

# Dataset
Utilized from Kaggle. The data was created with over 11 features and in total there are 4981 respondents. 
The target variable used is the binary ‘Stroke’ attribute, where 0 is no stroke, and 1 is a yes for a stroke. 
There are 10 input variables that are categorical or continuous.
